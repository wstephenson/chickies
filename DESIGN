each level requires you to hatch a range of chicks
to produce chicks you need a set of objects 

the requirements for each kind of chick differ
the progression is that the early levels require easy chicks to pass
the later levels require harder chicks that require all objects to make to pass

requirements are given by a count of the number of chicks of each kind needed to pass the level

 capability is signified by flashing the kind of chick you can lay
